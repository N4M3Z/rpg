## What do we expect?

List what we expect from this kind of adventure and then work out how you're going to make it different.

## Opening

How does this adventure start? Dramatically? With horror? Is it a barking dog frantically trying to speak Abyssal?

## Coolness

What makes your opening cool? Does it take place on the back of a giant whale? Inside the dreams of a long dead king? Is it a high-speed wagon chase over a chasm of lava?

## Non-player characters

You need a baddie, choose one. Henchmen are for filling the story up, Villains are highlights in the plot and the Nemesis is the entire point!
